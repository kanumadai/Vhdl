Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:2515 - The LUT-1 inverter
   "aurora/aurora_module_i/axi_to_ll_pdu_i/ll_ip_dst_rdy1_INV_0" failed to join
   the OLOGIC comp matched to output buffer "leds_7_OBUF".  This may result in
   suboptimal timing.  The LUT-1 inverter
   aurora/aurora_module_i/axi_to_ll_pdu_i/ll_ip_dst_rdy1_INV_0 drives multiple
   loads.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
