<msg type="info" file="Bitgen" num="40" delta="old" >Replacing &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">Auto</arg>&quot; with &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">NoWait</arg>&quot; for option &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="3">Match_cycle</arg>&quot;.  Most commonly, bitgen has determined and will use a specific value instead of the generic command-line value of &quot;Auto&quot;.  Alternately, this message appears if the same option is specified multiple times on the command-line.  In this case, the option listed last will be used.

<msg type="warning" file="PhysDesignRules" num="1842" delta="old" >One or more GTXs are being used in this design. Evaluate the SelectIO-To-GTX Crosstalk section of the Virtex-5 RocketIO GTX Transceiver User Guide to ensure that the design SelectIO usage meets the guidelines to minimize the impact on GTX performance.

<msg type="warning" file="PhysDesignRules" num="372" delta="old" >Gated clock. Clock net <arg fmt="%s" index="1">pcie/app/BMD/BMD_EP/EP_TX/BMD_INTR_CTRL/intr_done_or0000</arg> is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
